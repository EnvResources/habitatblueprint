## Definitions of Physical Habitat

The quality of physical habitat for juvenile salmonids is defined according to
specifications outlined by the Water Quality Parameter and Habitat Productivity
Technical Group. Habitat quality is assessed in terms of temperature, salinity
and dissolved oxygen thresholds, with four categories defined for each variable.
The individual ratings are then aggregated to classify overall habitat within 
13 categories. The habitat categories are defined below.

#### Temperature:

| optimal growth        | positive growth (suitable)                    | no or negative growth (stressful) | unsuitable           |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:|:--------------------:|
| $14-18^\circ\text{C}$ | $< 14^\circ\text{C}$ or $18-21^\circ\text{C}$ | $21--25^\circ\text{C}$            | $> 25^\circ\text{C}$ |

#### Dissolved Oxygen:

| function without impairment | suitable           | limited by lack of oxygen | unsuitable         |
|:---------------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------------------:|:------------------:|
| $> 6 \text{ mg/L}$          | $4-6 \text{ mg/L}$ | $3-4 \text{ mg/L}$        | $< 3 \text{ mg/L}$ |

#### Salinity:

| ion importing      | ion neutral         | induced ion exporting | ion exporting      |
|:------------------:|:-------------------:|:---------------------:|:------------------:|
| $< 10 \text{ ppt}$ | $10-15 \text{ ppt}$ | $15-28 \text{ ppt}$   | $> 28 \text{ ppt}$ |

#### Overall habitat

|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Optimal                          | all of: optimal growth (T), ion importing (S), function without impairment (DO)                 |
| Unsuitable                       | any one of: unsuitable (T), ion-exporting (S), unsuitable (DO)                                  |

| Stressful sub-optimal (T, S)     | (DO) as in "optimal" category; (T) as in "stressful" category; (S) as in "sub-optimal" category |
| Sub-optimal (T, S, DO)           | Suitable (T); (S) and (DO) as in "sub-optimal" categories                                       |
| Stressful sub-optimal (T, S, DO) | Stressful (T); (S) and (DO) as in "sub-optimal" categories                                      |

Habitat quality can additionally be assessed based on water depth, which has
important implications for foraging, shelter and predation risk. The Water 
Quality Parameter and Habitat Productivity Technical Group has additionally 
defined a separate set of habitat categories that assess habitat in terms of 
water depth.

| Category                  | Description                                                                                                   | Criteria                               |
|:--------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| Shallow/shoal (Littoral)  | high prey availability; high avian predation risk                                                             | $depth < 2\text{m}$ and $\max{(depth)} < 2\text{m}$    |
| Surface (Limnetic)        | lower prey availability; high avian predation risk                                                            | $depth < 2\text{m}$ and $\max{(depth)} \geq 2\text{m}$ |
| Subsurface (Limnetic)     | high prey availability where sediment $< 5\text{m}$; low prey availability where depth $>5\text{m}$); lower avian predation risk | $2\text{m} \leq depth \leq 5\text{m}$                   |
| Stagnant (Profundal) zone | unsuitable due to hypoxia/anoxia; low avian predation risk                                                    | $depth > 5\text{m}$                        |
