## Available Data

The Coastal Oceanography Group routinely performs 
Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) casts at 12 monitoring locations within 
the Russian River Estuary along a longitudinal transect. 
A single CTD cast contains data on water temperature,
salinity (derived from conductivity) and dissolved oxygen throughout the
water column. These data are interpolated to generate cross-sectional maps of
these water quality parameters using a natural neighbor interpolation algorithm.
Bathymetry data provided by the Sonoma Water Agency is used to laterally scale 
the water quality maps across the width of the estuary and develop estimates
of habitat volume.
